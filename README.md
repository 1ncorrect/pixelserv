pixelserv
=========

Tiny webserver that responds to all requests with "nothing".  Particularly useful for network connections with high latency and metered bandwidth.

This fork merges the mstombs and h0tw1r3 forks back together, and adds some additional cleanups and enhancements (most notably a stats reporting URL and finer-grained stats collection, as well as command-line configurable timeouts).
